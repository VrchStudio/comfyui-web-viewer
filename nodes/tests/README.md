### WebSocket Server Tests

The websocket_server_test.py file provides comprehensive testing for the WebSocket server functionality:

**websocket_server_test.py**: Comprehensive test suite with both unit and integration tests

#### Unit Tests (Safe, No Real Servers)
- ✓ Module import validation
- ✓ Server class instantiation testing  
- ✓ Path registration functionality
- ✓ Multiple path registration
- ✓ Channel management (1-8 channels per path)
- ✓ Send to channel method testing
- ✓ Global server registry management
- ✓ Method existence validation

#### Integration Tests (Real WebSocket Connections)
- ✓ Server lifecycle (startup/shutdown)
- ✓ Client connection and disconnection tracking
- ✓ Message broadcasting to multiple clients
- ✓ Channel isolation between different channels
- ✓ Global server functionality with multiple paths

#### Test Features
- **Dual Test Architecture**: Combines safe unit tests with real integration tests
- **Connection Tracking**: Validates that clients are properly tracked and removed
- **Message Broadcasting**: Tests real WebSocket message sending and receiving
- **Channel Isolation**: Ensures messages only reach intended channels
- **Error Handling**: Tests graceful handling of connection failures
- **Debug Output**: Comprehensive logging for troubleshooting

#### Running Tests
```bash
cd nodes/tests
python websocket_server_test.py
```

**Expected Output**: All 11 tests should pass (6 unit tests + 5 integration tests)

**Note**: Integration tests create real WebSocket servers and connections on localhost ports 9100-9105. Ensure these ports are available during testing.
