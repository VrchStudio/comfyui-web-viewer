# Tutorial 005: Storytelling with Text SRT Player

![](../workflows/example_text_nodes_001_text_srt_player.png)

## TL;DR

This tutorial guides you on how to use the **TEXT SRT Playe @ vrch.air** node from [**ComfyUI Web Viewer**](https://github.com/VrchStudio/comfyui-web-viewer), leveraging SRT subtitle files with timestamps to dynamically control storytelling images generation. Combined with the **IMAGE Preview in Background** node, you can create a fully automated, timestamp-based storytelling experience with real-time AI-generated visuals in ComfyUI.

**Practical Use Cases**:
- Interactive storytelling for exhibitions or live performances.
- Dynamic AI-generated visual experiences for streaming or live events.
- Real-time creative sessions with precise narrative control.

     ```
   - Edit and past the SRT Format text into `TEXT SRT Player @ vrch.ai` node

3. **Enable and Start Queue (Instant) Mode**
   - Activate **Queue (Instant)** mode in ComfyUI for real-time prompt processing.
4. **Click [Play SRT File] Button to Start SRT Text Switch**
   - Click the **[Play SRT File]** button in the `TEXT SRT Player @ vrch.ai` node to initiate playback. 
   - The node automatically sends prompts to the workflow according to timestamps.

5. **Enjoy Real-time Visual Storytelling!**
   - Generated images appear dynamically in your ComfyUI interface via the **`IMAGE Preview in Background @ vrch.ai`** node.
   - Images will switch automatically based on SRT timestamps, delivering a smooth storytelling experience.


### 2. Using Your Artworks Outside of ComfyUI

To showcase your real-time AI-generated visuals externally:

- Replace the node **`IMAGE Preview in Background @ vrch.ai`** with the **`IMAGE Web Viewer @ vrch.ai`** node.
- After replacement, click the **[Open Web Viewer]** button.
- A new browser window/tab will open, displaying your real-time storytelling images.

#### Tips for External Viewing:
1. Make sure your **Server** address and **SSL** settings in `IMAGE Web Viewer @ vrch.ai` are correct for your network environment. If you want to access the audio from another device or over the internet, ensure that the server IP/domain is reachable and ports are open.
2. If youâ€™re encountering a CORS policy error with a message like this:
   > `WARNING: request with non matching host and origin 127.0.0.1 != vrch.ai, returning 403`
   
   you can resolve this by launching the ComfyUI service with the `--enable-cors-header` flag appended, e.g.
   `python main.py --enable-cors-header`
