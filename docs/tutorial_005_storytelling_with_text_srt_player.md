3. **Enable and Start Queue (Instant) Mode**

4. **Click [Play SRT File] Button to Start SRT Text Switch**

5. **Enjoy the Result!**
   - The generated images will be displayed in ComfyUI page directly (via `IMAGE Preview in Background @ vrch.ai` node) and switched based on the time interval defined in SRT Text 

### 2. Use Your Artwork Outside of ComfyUI

You may simply replace the `IMAGE Preview in Background @ vrch.ai` node with the `IMAGE Web Viewer @ vrch.ai` node from the [**ComfyUI Web Viewer**](https://github.com/VrchStudio/comfyui-web-viewer) plugin, then click at **[Open Web Viewer]** button and then a new browser window (or tab) will open to play your artworks in it.

#### Tips
1. Make sure your **Server** address and **SSL** settings in `IMAGE Web Viewer @ vrch.ai` are correct for your network environment. If you want to access the audio from another device or over the internet, ensure that the server IP/domain is reachable and ports are open.
2. If youâ€™re encountering a CORS policy error with a message like this:
   > `WARNING: request with non matching host and origin 127.0.0.1 != vrch.ai, returning 403`
   
   you can resolve this by launching the ComfyUI service with the `--enable-cors-header` flag appended, e.g.
   `python main.py --enable-cors-header`
